# Wireframing

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product (website or app). It focuses on layout, structure, and placement of elements without detailed visuals like colors or images so teams can agree on **what goes where** and **how users will flow** through the interface.

### Why Itâ€™s Important in the Design Process
- **Clarity & Focus:** Keeps attention on functionality and user flow before visual design.
- **Better Communication:** Gives designers, developers, and stakeholders a shared blueprint.
- **Early Usability Checks:** Surfaces navigation/layout issues before costly development.
- **Saves Time & Cost:** Faster to adjust wireframes than rework finished UI or code.

In short, wireframing is the blueprint that bridges product ideas with practical, user-friendly solutions.
