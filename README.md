# Wireframing

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product (website or app). It focuses on layout, structure, and placement of elements without detailed visuals like colors or images so teams can agree on **what goes where** and **how users will flow** through the interface.

### Why It’s Important in the Design Process
- **Clarity & Focus:** Keeps attention on functionality and user flow before visual design.
- **Better Communication:** Gives designers, developers, and stakeholders a shared blueprint.
- **Early Usability Checks:** Surfaces navigation/layout issues before costly development.
- **Saves Time & Cost:** Faster to adjust wireframes than rework finished UI or code.

In short, wireframing is the blueprint that bridges product ideas with practical, user-friendly solutions.


## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes focus on core building blocks of a design. The four key elements are:

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall arrangement of sections on a page (header, body, footer, sidebars).  
*Example:* A homepage wireframe shows the logo at the top, a main content area in the center, and a footer with links.

### 2. Navigation
Represents how users move between screens or sections.  
*Example:* A top navigation bar with “Home,” “About,” and “Contact” helps users find their way.

### 3. Content Placement
Shows where text, images, forms, or videos will appear without focusing on design details.  
*Example:* A blog wireframe may use boxes labeled “Image” and “Text” to mark where posts go.

### 4. Functionality
Highlights interactive features that drive user action.  
*Example:* Buttons for “Sign Up” or a search bar are included in the wireframe to represent actions.

✅ These elements together ensure the design communicates structure, usability, and user flow before colors and visual styles are added.
